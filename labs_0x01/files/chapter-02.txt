Behind the port lay  the city, factory domes  dominated  by the vast  cubes of corporate  arcologies. 
Port and city were  divided by  a narrow borderland  of older  streets,  an  area with  no official  name. 
Night  City, with  Ninsei its  heart.  
By day, the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless, the neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting, under the poisoned silver sky.
